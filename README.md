## ⚙️ How the Website Was Built

1. The project was created using **Next.js** and organized into reusable components for each section.  
2. **Vercel v0** was used to generate the basic UI layouts (Hero, Features, Testimonials, and Pricing).  
3. All generated sections were cleaned, edited, and refactored manually for consistency.  
4. Tailwind CSS classes were adjusted (spacing, fonts, alignment, responsiveness) for a clean final look.  
5. Components were placed inside the Next.js app folder, and the final landing page was built through imports.  
6. The entire codebase was tested across different screen sizes using Tailwind breakpoints.  
7. Finally, the site was deployed using **Vercel** for fast, production-ready hosting.
